# 🎨 CSS Background Overlay Project

This project is a personal exploration of how to style a full-screen background with overlays and centered content using modern CSS techniques. It was created as part of my learning journey in frontend development.

## 🔧 Features

- Full-screen background image with smooth overlay
- Centered icon or text using Flexbox
- Clean structure with semantic HTML & CSS
- Responsive design that adjusts to screen sizes
- Uses `position`, `z-index`, and `flex` layouts

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Clone this repository to your computer  
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser  
3. Resize the window to explore how the layout behaves

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- Using `background-image` with `cover` and `center`  
- Overlaying content using `position: relative` and `absolute`  
- Centering using Flexbox  
- Structuring a responsive layout  
- Writing clean and maintainable CSS

## 🙌 Special Thanks

This project was inspired by my frontend training at ALX and built entirely from scratch by me.
